    <h class="header">Who am i? </h>
    <p>
        I am a basically just your average tenage nerd lol. I love 
        to code and spend most of my time doing it.My favourite colour 
        is purple, hence the main colours of the website. I am 16 years 
        old and live on a small island in the Caribbean called <b>St.Lucia</b>.
        I code in <b>python, javascript, html</b> and <b>css</b> and i am currently learning <b>c#</b>.
        I currently go to a highscool in my hometown called the <b>Castries Comprehensive Secondary School</b>.
    </p>
    <h class="header">Why do i code?</h>
    <p>
        I have a fascination with code. I can sit on my pc for <b>6-10</b> hours a day
        just making useless programs that i will never use lol. Just the thought
        of knowing that i created something, all by myself gives me a sense of satisfaction.
        There have been many times that i have been brought down for knowing code, or being a 
        "nerd" but that does not matter. I enjoy what i do and i will do it no matter what.
